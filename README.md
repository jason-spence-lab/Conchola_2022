This repository contains code for bioinformatics analyses as seen in "Distinct airway progenitor cells drive epithelial heterogeneity in the developing human lung" - Ansley S. Conchola et al. (2022).

Abstract: Recent advances using single cell genomic approaches have identified new epithelial cell types and uncovered cellular heterogeneity in the murine and human lung(1). Here, we use scRNA-seq and imaging to identify and describe a secretory precursor cell that is enriched in the small airways of the developing human lung and identified by the unique co-expression of SCGB3A2/SFTPB/CFTR. To study this cell, we describe an in vitro organoid approach that allows us to induce and track the fate of SCGB3A2/SFTPB/CFTR cells using CellTagging (2), a single cell barcode-based lineage tracing method. Lineage tracing revealed that these cells are a precursor for pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and a subset of multiciliated cells marked by C6 that are distinct from basal cell derived multiciliated cells, which are defined by MUC16 expression. Together this study reveals that there are multiple progenitor cell types contributing to the cellular diversity and heterogeneity in the developing human airway.
